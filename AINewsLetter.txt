"Build a real-world, modern, and beautiful website called 'Smart AI Newsletter' that helps users discover and share the latest AI news automatically.

The website should include:

A clean, responsive homepage with a headline like 'Stay Ahead with the Smart AI Newsletter', a short description, and a call-to-action to subscribe.

A newsletter subscription form integrated with email (use a dummy email API or Firebase for now).

A dashboard or admin panel to manage and curate AI news content.

A backend that fetches trending AI articles using AI or RSS feeds, summarizes them, and prepares them for newsletter distribution.

Automatic newsletter generation every week with top AI news.

Deploy the project using Vercel with a CI/CD pipeline.

Use modern tech stack like React , Tailwind CSS, Node.js (or Firebase), and integrate with OpenAI for summaries or titles.

Make the UI elegant, mobile-friendly, and professional. Include animations or transitions for a modern feel.

Also, provide a README with setup instructions for developers who want to contribute."**
